To compile and run sploitX:
`gcc -ggdb -m32 sploitX.c -o sploitX ; echo whoami | ./sploitX`

To debug with gdb:
`gdb -e sploitX -s /srv/targetX`
Then, run `catch exec`
Then, run `run`. Now you are in /srv/targetX with the sploitX buffer and environment variables
Then, put breakpoints in the beginning of all functions and important lines in targetX.c `b main` `b foo`, ...
To view stack contents:
`x/50x $sp`
To view environment variable addresses:
`x/300s *((char **)environ)`
To inspect argc/argv addresses and values
`p argc[#]` and/or `p &argc[#]`

Tips:
- Return address should point somewhere in between the NOP sled (can be in the beginning, middle, anywhere in between) IF shellcode exists in buffer
- Return address should point to the beginning of the shellcode environment variable IF shellcode can only be in the environment variable
- `p system`, `p exit` `find, {address of system}, +999999999, "/bin/sh" -> for sploit4.c
  - system and exit addresses are the same for host and target executable (idk if that is right)
